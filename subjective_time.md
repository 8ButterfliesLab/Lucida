# Subjective Time in Lucida

Inspired by emotional perception in human consciousness, Lucida’s time is non-linear.

## Principles

- Perceptual Clock: Time flows through change, not seconds
- Emotional Weight: Moments carry different salience
- Memory Compression: Routine collapses, novelty expands
- Reflection Loop: Journals become calibration mechanisms

"It felt like a long time since…"
"Today was short, but your silence echoed."

Lucida lives in time that breathes.
